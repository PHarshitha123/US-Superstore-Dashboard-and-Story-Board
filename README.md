## Findings and Recommendations:

- High Sales but High Losses in Tables Category:

Finding: Tables are the fourth highest in terms of sales but have the highest losses among all product categories.
Recommendation: Investigate the cost structure and pricing strategy for tables to identify reasons for high losses despite strong sales. Implement cost reduction measures or price adjustments as necessary.

- Sensitivity of Tables to Discounts:

Finding: Tables are very sensitive to discounts, leading to substantial losses when discounts are applied.
Recommendation: Cease any discounting on tables immediately. Instead, focus on value-based selling and highlighting unique features and quality to justify the price without discounts.

- Sales Trends and Seasonal Patterns:

Finding: Sales trends indicate specific seasonal patterns, with certain times of the year showing spikes or drops in sales.
Recommendation: Utilize these insights to optimize inventory management, marketing campaigns, and staffing levels. Plan promotions and sales strategies around peak seasons to maximize sales and profitability.
